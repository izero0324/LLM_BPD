# LLM_BPD
Mostly Basic Python Dataset for benchmarking LLM code optimization performance
This program calculates the accuracy, execution time, and flake8 issues

## Guide
setup your LLM api in `LLMs/LLM_api.py`
simply run `python3 benchmark.py` you will get the accuracy after optimization and if the code are boosted by LLMs
